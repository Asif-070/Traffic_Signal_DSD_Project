# 🚦 Traffic Control System (Verilog HDL)

A **Digital System Design (DSD) Laboratory Project** simulating a traffic light control system using **Verilog HDL** as coursework at KUET. The project demonstrates the integration of digital components like **ALU, control unit, and flip-flops** to model real-world traffic signal behavior.

## 💡 Project Idea
The system simulates a traffic light controller:  

- An **ALU** decrements predefined time while states are stored in flip-flops.  
- Control logic transitions the lights between **Red → Green → Yellow**.  
- The current state (light color) is displayed in the terminal output.
